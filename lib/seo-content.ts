  {
    q: "Is this actually free or is there a catch?",
    a: "It's genuinely free! The catch? You need to watch other creators' content to earn coins. That's it. No hidden fees, no credit card required, no premium tiers you need to unlock basic features."
  },
  {
    q: "But like... are these real people watching?",
    a: "100% real humans! Every view comes from actual creators in our community. No bots, no fake accounts, no view farms. Just real people discovering and watching real content."
  },
  {
    q: "How is this different from those sketchy view bots?",
    a: "Night and day difference! View bots are fake, get you banned, and don't help your channel grow. We're real creators watching each other's content, giving genuine feedback, and building actual communities."
  },
  {
    q: "Will YouTube ban my channel for using this?",
    a: "Nope! We're 100% YouTube compliant. No bots, no fake accounts - just real creators watching each other's content. It's like having a supportive friend group, but bigger."
  },
  {
    q: "is this gonna get my channel banned or something?",
    a: "Not at all! We follow YouTube's terms of service completely. Real people, real views, real engagement. YouTube actually loves when creators support each other organically."
  },
  {
    q: "but like... what's the catch? nothing's actually free",
    a: "Fair question! It's free because it's community-powered. You watch videos to earn coins, then spend coins to get views. Everyone wins - creators get discovered, viewers find great content."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I know these aren't just bot views?",
    a: "Because you'll see real comments, real engagement, and real feedback from actual humans. Bots can't leave thoughtful comments or subscribe because they genuinely enjoyed your content."
  },
  {
    q: "What if my content sucks?",
    a: "Then you'll get honest feedback to help you improve! Our community is supportive but real. Plus, 'sucks' is subjective - your content might be perfect for someone else's taste."
  },
  {
    q: "How many coins do I need to promote my video?",
    a: "It varies based on your target audience size, but you can start promoting with as little as 50 coins. Most creators earn that by watching 10-15 videos from others."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I just watch random stuff to earn coins?",
    a: "You could, but you'll get better results engaging with content you actually enjoy. Plus, the algorithm learns your preferences and shows you better matches over time."
